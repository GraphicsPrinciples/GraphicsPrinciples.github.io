# Graphics principles 

This is the home page for effective visual communication and graphical principles for quantitative scientists.  

Effective visual communication is a core skill for all quantitative scientists including statisticians, epidemiologists, machine learning experts, bioinformaticians, etc. By using the right graphical principles, we can better understand data, highlight core insights and influence decisions toward appropriate actions. Without it, we can fool ourselves and others and pave the way to wrong conclusions and actions. 

The goal of these pages is to help quantitative scientists to get this right.

We hope that this page proves beneficial for your work. It will evolve further over time.
