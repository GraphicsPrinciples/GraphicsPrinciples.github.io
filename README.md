# Graphics principles cheatsheet

This is the home page for the [Graphics Principles cheatsheet](https://github.com/GraphicsPrinciples/CheatSheet/blob/master/NVSCheatSheet.pdf). The [cheatsheet](https://github.com/GraphicsPrinciples/CheatSheet/blob/master/NVSCheatSheet.pdf) is available on GitHub along with [R code](https://github.com/GraphicsPrinciples/CheatSheet) for many of the examples. The link to the cheatsheet github repository can be found [here](https://github.com/GraphicsPrinciples/CheatSheet). 

The [Graphics Principles cheatsheet](https://github.com/GraphicsPrinciples/CheatSheet/blob/master/NVSCheatSheet.pdf) is one deliverable of a [graphics initiative](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pst.1912) to increase the graphical expertise and productivity of quantitative scientists at [Novartis](https://www.novartis.com/our-science). 

For more information on the [initiative](initiative.html) please check out our publication: [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pst.1912](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pst.1912) 

We also have prepared a [tutorial](tutorial.html) on "Effective visual communication for the quantitative scientist" which is in submission and can be found [at CPT:PSP here](https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/psp4.12455). Example code for the [case studies](https://graphicsprinciples.github.io/tutorial-case-studies) is available [here](https://github.com/GraphicsPrinciples/tutorial-viz-com). 

A pre-print of the tutorial can also be found at: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09512](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09512).
