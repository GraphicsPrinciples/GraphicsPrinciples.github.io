In the [tutorial](https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/psp4.12455) we posit three laws of Effective Visual Communication for the quantitative scientist: have a clear purpose, show the data clearly, and make the message obvious. The [tutorial](https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/psp4.12455) provides more granularity on these laws; it covers the Graphics Principles [Cheat Sheet](cheatsheet.html); and it discusses the application of both in four [Case Studies](https://graphicsprinciples.github.io/tutorial-case-studies).

These laws and recommendations are illustrated in a collection of [case study notebooks](https://graphicsprinciples.github.io/tutorial-case-studies). [Example code](https://github.com/GraphicsPrinciples/tutorial-viz-com) from the tutorial is also available.
