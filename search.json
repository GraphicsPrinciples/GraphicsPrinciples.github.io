      "contents": "\n\n\n\nEffective visual communication is a core skill for all quantitative scientists including statisticians, epidemiologists, machine learning experts, bioinformaticians, etc. By using the right graphical principles, we can better understand data, highlight core insights and influence decisions toward appropriate actions. Without it, we can fool ourselves and others and pave the way to wrong conclusions and actions.\nThe goal of these pages is to help quantitative scientists to get this right. More specifically, you will find:\nThe three laws of effective visual communication\nA graphics principles cheat sheet\nA tutorial covering both of the above more comprehensively\nExample case studies from this tutorial with programming code for download\nThe concept of Question-Based Visualizations (QBV)\nA blog with various related articles\nSome further background of this initiative, including a related overview paper\nLinks to further resources & references\nWe hope that these page prove beneficial for your work. They will evolve further over time.\nCorrections or questions\nIf you see mistakes, want to suggest changes or ask us a question, please create an issue on the source repository or email directly\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "The concept of question-based visualizations posits to first carve out the scientific question of interest clearly and explicitly, and then only to shift attention to the data at hand and any possible visualizations. \n",
      "author": [],
      "contents": "\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Screenshot from the question-based visualization pilot (data anonymized)\n\n\n\nPresently, graphics are often designed “bottom up,” that is, we start from the data and decide how best to display it. However, a graph is most impactful if it is designed to answer a question, so it may be more meaningful to start from the question. To this end, consider a “top down” approach. The first step is to explicitly identify and agree on the question of interest before any data are even considered. Then, and only then, it is decided how to best craft a graph (or set of graphs) to answer this question. This subtle yet important shift in the process of graph creation helps focus the graph on answering the question of interest most clearly.\nFor more details, please see this presentation and the relevant section of the paper of this initiative.
