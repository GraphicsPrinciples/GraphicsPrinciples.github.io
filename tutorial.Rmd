  Effective Visual Communication is essential in every step of a quantitative workflow, from scoping to execution and communicating results and conclusions. The goal of the [tutorial](https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/psp4.12455) is to convey this competency.

In the [tutorial](https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/psp4.12455) we posit three laws of Effective Visual Communication for the quantitative scientist: have a clear purpose, show the data clearly, and make the message obvious. The [tutorial](https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/psp4.12455) provides more granularity on these laws; it covers the Graphics Principles [Cheat Sheet](cheatsheet.html); and it discusses the application of both in four [Case Studies](https://graphicsprinciples.github.io/tutorial-case-studies).

```{r, fig.cap="Example visualistion from the tutorial"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/Case-study.png")
```

These laws and recommendations are illustrated in a collection of [case study notebooks](https://graphicsprinciples.github.io/tutorial-case-studies).

Example code from the tutorial is available [here](https://github.com/GraphicsPrinciples/tutorial-viz-com).
