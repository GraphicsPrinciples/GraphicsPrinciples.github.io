We also have prepared a tutorial on "Effective visual communication for the quantitative scientist" which is in submission. A pre-print can be found at: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09512](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09512) 

Example code for the case studies is available [here](https://github.com/GraphicsPrinciples/tutorial-viz-com).
