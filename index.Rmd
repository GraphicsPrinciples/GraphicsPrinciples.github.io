The [Graphics Principles cheatsheet](https://github.com/GraphicsPrinciples/CheatSheet/blob/master/NVSCheatSheet.pdf) is one deliverable of an initiative to increase the expertise and productivity of quantitative scientists at [Novartis](https://www.novartis.com/our-science). 

For more information on the [initiative](initiative.html) please check out our publication: [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pst.1912](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pst.1912) 

We also have published a [tutorial](tutorial.html) on "Effective visual communication for the quantitative scientist", which is online and available [at CPT:PSP](https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/psp4.12455). Example code for the [case studies](https://graphicsprinciples.github.io/tutorial-case-studies) are also available [here](https://github.com/GraphicsPrinciples/tutorial-viz-com).
