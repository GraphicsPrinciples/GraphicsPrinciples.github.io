**This is the landing page for the [Graphics Principles cheatsheet](https://github.com/GraphicsPrinciples/CheatSheet/blob/master/NVSCheatSheet.pdf).** The [cheatsheet](https://github.com/GraphicsPrinciples/CheatSheet/blob/master/NVSCheatSheet.pdf) is available on GitHub along with [R code](https://github.com/GraphicsPrinciples/CheatSheet) for many of the examples. The link to the cheatsheet github repository is [here](https://github.com/GraphicsPrinciples/CheatSheet). 

**The [Graphics Principles cheatsheet](https://github.com/GraphicsPrinciples/CheatSheet/blob/master/NVSCheatSheet.pdf) is one deliverable of a [graphics initiative](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pst.1912)** to increase the graphical expertise and productivity of quantitative scientists at Novartis. We also have prepared a tutorial on "Effective visual communication for the quantitative scientist" which is in submission. A pre-print can be found at: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09512](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09512) 

The initative work packages include:
- **The Graph Gallery** - a company-wide resource for graphics and corresponding code, displayed in a web browser
- **The Graphics Principles Cheat Sheet** - a reference sheet summarizing essential graphical display principles on a single page
- **The Graphics Newsletter** - an email communication covering anything and everything relevant to graphics, distributed every two months to approximately 1100 recipients within Novartis, including statisticians, pharmacometricians, medical writers, and various other functions.
- **Analysis Results Datasets (ARD)** - a data standard designed as an extension to the CDISC Analysis Data Model (ADaM) to store results from related inferencial analyses and aggregated statistics for easy production of outputs
- **Standardization of common graphs** - a handful of carefully curated graphs selected to represent preapproved standard graphs for inclusion in regulated documents, and included in the Output Governance system (a repository of preapproved standard tables and listings which previously had not included figures)
- **Question-based visualizations** - a work package to encourage a more "top down" approach to creating graphs which starts with the question of interest, followed by the selection of data and graph to best answer the question (instead of the other way around)
